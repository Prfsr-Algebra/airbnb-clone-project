**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Email address (unique)
- `password`: Encrypted password
- `is_host`: Boolean flag indicating if the user can list properties

**Relationships:**
- A user **can own multiple properties**
- A user **can make multiple bookings**
- A user **can leave multiple reviews**

### Properties
Represents a place listed for booking.

**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the user who listed the property
- `title`: Name of the property
- `description`: Detailed description
- `location`: Address or city
- `price_per_night`: Cost to rent per night

**Relationships:**
- A property **belongs to one user (host)**
- A property **can have many bookings**
- A property **can have many reviews**

### Bookings
Represents reservations made by users.

**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the guest (user)
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the booked property
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date
- `total_price`: Calculated price based on nights

**Relationships:**
- A booking **belongs to one user**
- A booking **belongs to one property**

### Reviews
Represents feedback left by users after a stay.

**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the reviewer
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the reviewed property
- `rating`: Numerical rating (e.g., 1–5)
- `comment`: Textual review

**Relationships:**
- A review **belongs to one user**
- A review **belongs to one property**

### Payments
Represents payment transactions for bookings.

**Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key to the associated booking
- `amount`: Amount paid
- `payment_date`: Date of payment
- `payment_status`: Status (e.g., Paid, Pending, Failed)

**Relationships:**
- A payment **is tied to one booking**

## Feature Breakdown:

### API Documentation

- **OpenAPI Standard:** The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.

- **Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.

- **GraphQL:** Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

### User Authentication
- **Endpoints:** /users/, /users/{user_id}/
- **Features:** Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### Property Management
- **Endpoints:** /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
- **Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### Booking System
- **Endpoints:** /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
- **Features:** Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### Payment Processing
- **Endpoints:** /payments/
- **Features:** Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

### Review System
- **Endpoints:** /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
- **Features:** Post and manage reviews for properties.

### Database Optimizations
- **Indexing:** Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- **Caching:** Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security:
Ensuring the security of the backend API is critical to protect sensitive data, prevent abuse, and maintain user trust. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### Authentication
Only registered users should be able to access protected endpoints.

- **Implementation**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used for stateless authentication.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and private data such as bookings, payments, and personal profiles.

### Authorization
Defines what authenticated users are allowed to do.

- **Implementation**: Role-based access control (e.g., host vs guest) to restrict actions like editing properties or viewing others’ bookings.
- **Why it matters**: Protects resources by ensuring that users can only access or modify data they own or have permission for.

### Rate Limiting
Limits how often a user can make API requests in a given time frame.

- **Implementation**: Throttling via Django REST Framework or middleware.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and protects the system from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is strictly validated to prevent harmful input.

- **Implementation**: Use DRF serializers and custom validators.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.

### Secure Payment Handling
Sensitive payment data is never stored directly in the system.

- **Implementation**: Integration with trusted third-party payment gateways like Stripe or Paystack via HTTPS.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures financial data is processed securely and reduces compliance burden.

### HTTPS Only
All communication with the API must be encrypted.

- **Implementation**: Force HTTPS in production via middleware or server configuration.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and protects data in transit.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery)** is a software development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications. It ensures that updates are reliable, consistent, and delivered quickly.

### Why CI/CD is Important for This Project

- **Automated Testing**: Ensures new code doesn't break existing functionality.
- **Faster Development**: Automates repetitive tasks like builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Consistency**: Ensures the app is built and deployed the same way every time.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catches errors early in the pipeline before reaching production.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Makes it easier for multiple developers to contribute to the project without breaking things.

### Tools That Can Be Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows like testing, linting, and deployment on every push or pull request.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Heroku** or **Render**: Cloud platforms that support auto-deployment via GitHub integration.
- **PostgreSQL**: Common production-grade database for containerized CI environments.
- **pytest / coverage.py**: For automated testing and code coverage reporting.

### Sample Pipeline Steps

1. **Code push to GitHub**
2. **Run automated tests and linting (GitHub Actions)**
3. **Build Docker image (optional)**
4. **Deploy to Heroku / Render if tests pass**
